Here are xlsx files of our human evaluations.
Each row is a question with their choices and metrics for your reference. 

Labeling guidelines are following：

题目来源于药综考试模拟题，每个题目5个选项，答案为题目的标准答案。
I和J列分别是不同方法生成的语句，对应于人类答题之后的解析。
请标注最后四列的值，每一个单元格3个取值：0,-1,1
1代表第一种方法在这个指标上大于第二个方法
-1代表第二种方法在这种指标上大于第一种方法，
0代表两种差不多，分辨不出来（尽量少一些）。


因果度代表题目、答案和生成解释的关联程度（从因果关系上）；
信息度代表解释本身的信息量是否丰富；
流利度就是人工读起来是否顺畅，主观感受。
重复代表重复的片段的多少，和流利度不同的是主观上句子中是否有更少无意义的重复片段，

English version:
The questions are derived from the drug comprehensive examination mock questions, each with 5 options, and the answer is the standard answer to the question.
Columns I and J are sentences generated by different methods, corresponding to the analysis after humans answer the questions.
Please mark the values of the last four columns, each cell has 3 values: 0,-1,1
1 means the first method is greater than the second method in this indicator
-1 means that the second method is greater than the first method in this index,
0 means that the two are similar and cannot be distinguished (as few as possible).


The degree of causality represents the degree of relevance (in terms of causality) between the question, the answer and the generated explanation;
The degree of information represents whether the amount of information to explain itself is rich;
Fluency is the subjective feeling of whether it is easy to read manually.
Repetition represents the number of repeated fragments. The difference from fluency is whether there are fewer meaningless repeated fragments in the sentence subjectively.
